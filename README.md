# DuckyMenu
I created a shell script to help manage my ducky scripts and to copy what i wanted to use to the root of the drive.  After creating it, i wanted to post it just incase anyone else might find it useful.

I made this shell script on a mac, and also tested it out on another linux based box and didn’t have any problems.  The only thing I had to do on the mac was download the “dialog” command via brew.
